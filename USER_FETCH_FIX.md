# 🔧 Fix: Users Not Being Fetched in Admin Panel

## 🚨 **Root Cause Identified**

The issue is with **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** in your Supabase database. The current policies only allow users to view their own profiles, but there's no policy allowing admins to view all users.

## 📋 **Current Database Policies**

From your `supabase_users_table.sql`:

```sql
-- Users can view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile" ON users
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = auth_user_id);

-- Admin policy is commented out:
-- CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all users" ON users
--     FOR ALL USING (auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin');
```

## ✅ **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Fix RLS Policies (Recommended)**

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Allow admins to view all users
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all users" ON users
    FOR SELECT USING (
        auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin' OR
        auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role' = 'admin' OR
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM users
            WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()
            AND account_type = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Allow admins to update user status
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update user status" ON users
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin' OR
        auth.jwt() ->> 'user_role' = 'admin' OR
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM users
            WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid()
            AND account_type = 'admin'
        )
    );

-- Grant additional permissions
GRANT SELECT, UPDATE ON users TO authenticated;
```

### **Option 2: Temporary RLS Disable (For Testing Only)**

```sql
-- ⚠️ ONLY for testing - NOT for production
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### **Option 3: Use Service Role Key**

If you have a service role key, you can create a separate Supabase client for admin operations:

```typescript
// In your user-service.ts
const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY! // Add this to your .env.local
);
```

## 🔍 **Debug Information Added**

I've added comprehensive debugging to help identify the issue:

1. **Console Logging**: Check browser console for detailed logs
2. **Debug Panel**: Shows connection status and user count
3. **Error Handling**: Better error messages for RLS issues

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for the debug messages I added
2. **Run the SQL Fix**: Execute the RLS policy fix in Supabase
3. **Test the Admin Panel**: Refresh the page and check if users load
4. **Remove Debug Code**: Once working, we can remove the debug logging

## 📊 **Expected Console Output**

You should see logs like:

```
🎯 Component mounted, starting user fetch...
🔧 Testing Supabase connection...
👤 Current user: { id: "...", email: "..." }
📊 Table access test: { data: [...], error: null }
🔍 Fetching users from Supabase...
✅ Successfully fetched users: X users
```

If you see RLS/policy errors, that confirms the issue and the SQL fix will resolve it.

## 🔐 **Security Note**

The RLS policies are important for security. Make sure to:

- Only grant admin access to trusted users
- Test thoroughly before deploying to production
- Consider using service role keys for admin operations instead of modifying RLS
